## NFC Ideas

NFC solves the problem of power. The case would not need to be charged periodically, and information could be passed through NFC.
Since the phone case is always immediately next to the phone, the NFC will always be working.  

### Issues

NFC capability is only on iPhone 6 and up. This is not that big of an issue because most people have this version or better.
Almost all Androids have NFC capability.

Transmission late is slow. For this use case, it shouldn't matter much.  

IOS 13+ is required for NFC writing capability. This is also not much of an issue as most people have this or can update to it.
